    $ Remember to buy milk.

    # You are now ready to use it.

## Plans:

##### This project has definitely interested me a lot, and there are couple of things that I could do in order to improve noty.

##### First and foremost, I am currently working on finding a way not to necessarily have the terminal open while running noty. Right now, if you close the terminal, noty will close as well which can be proven annoying for a wide variety of users.

##### Also, I would love to implement an alarm like feature, that will remind you of your notes. I am not currently working on that, but I have some plans for the future. Let me make an example.
   
    # Run it
    $ noty

    # Type your notes.
    $ Remember to buy milk.
    
    $ Would you like us to remind you of that?
    $ Yes.
    
    # If you do not want a reminder, you could simply leave it blank. 
    # In this case, I am just illustrating the reminder option that may come some time in the future.
    
    $ Please enter the time, you want us to remind it to you.
    $ 5.30
    
    # In this case, noty will remind you to buy milk at 5.30.

    # Keep in mind that this hasn't been implemented as yet and nothing is 100 percent sure.
    # With that being said, I will try as hard as I can in order to actually implement it. Thanks for understanding!
